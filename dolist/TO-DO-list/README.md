# TO-DO-list

A To-Do List Web Application allows users to manage their tasks and stay organized by adding, editing, and deleting tasks. Itâ€™s typically built with frontend technologies for the user interface and backend technologies for task data storage and management. Below is a simple outline to create a To-Do List web application:

Basic Features:
Task Creation: Allow users to add tasks to their list.
Task Deletion: Allow users to remove tasks they no longer need.
Task Editing: Enable users to edit the task description if needed.
Task Completion: Mark tasks as completed, which could visually strike them out or move them to a "completed" section.
Persistent Storage: Store the list of tasks so they persist even after the user closes the browser.
User Interface: Design a simple and responsive UI with options to add, edit, delete, and complete tasks.
